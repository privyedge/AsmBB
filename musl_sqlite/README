In order to build the required by AsmBB libraries (musl and sqlite3) 
you need to have the following tools installed and working:

gcc
tar
unzip
wget

Most of the Linux distributions have these tools already installed.
You don't need to have root priviledges. Never run this script as 
a root or with sudo!

In case the source files for the libraries are missing, the
script will download the latest versions from the respective
servers.

If you want to use other version, download it and place the archive
file in this directory. The script is looking for:

"musl*.tar.gz" for MUSL

"sqlite3.c", "sqlite*.zip" or "sqlite*.tar.gz" for SQLite.

If such file exists the script will use it. If not, tries to download
the latest sources from the respective Internet sites.

The most simple use of the script (although slower) is to delete all 
archives and source files from the directory and run:

$ ./build

The script will compile the sqlite3 library with musl and will create
two files: "libsqlite3.so" and "ld-musl-i386.so"; Copy these files
in the AsmBB directory in order to use them.

This script is called automatically from the script 
"install/create_relese.sh" that creates the binary release archives.


Report every building problems. I am testing on Manjaro/Arch linux
and some problems on other distributions are possible (but not expected).
