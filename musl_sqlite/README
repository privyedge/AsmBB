In order to build the required by AsmBB libraries (musl and sqlite3) 
you need to have the following tools installed and working:

gcc
tar
unzip
wget

Most of the Linux distributions have these tools already installed.
You don't need to have root priviledges. Never run this script as 
a root or with sudo!

In case the source files for the libraries are missing, the
script will download the latest versions from the respective
servers.

If you want to use other version, download it and place the archive
file in this directory. The script is looking for:

"musl*.tar.gz" for MUSL
"sqlite*.tar.gz" or "sqlite*.zip" for SQLite

If such file exists the script will use it. If not, tries to download
the latest sources.

The most simple use of the script is to delete all archives from the 
directory and run:

$ ./build

The script will compile the sqlite3 library with musl and will copy
the needed files to the binary directory of AsmBB (../www/)

Report every building problems. I am testing on Manjaro/Arch linux
and some problems on other distributions are possible (but not expected).
