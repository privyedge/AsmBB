In order to build the required by AsmBB libraries (musl and sqlite3) 
you need to have the following tools installed and working:

gcc
tar
unzip

Most of the Linux distributions have these tools already installed.
You don't need to have root priviledges. Never run this script as 
a root or with sudo!

Then follow these steps:

1. Download from: 

https://www.musl-libc.org/download.html 

...the latest (or older) version of MUSL library.
It is named "musl-X.X.XX.tar.gz" where X is a digit. 

Place the tarball in this directory.

2. Download from:

https://www.sqlite.org/download.html 

...the latest (or older) amalgamation sources archive of sqlite3 sources.
There are several options, named:

sqlite-snapshot-XXXXXXXXXXXX.tar.gz - for the latest pre-release snapshot.
sqlite-amalgamation-XXXXXXX.zip - for the official release.

(There are other options, but they are not suitable for this build)
Place the sqlite3 source archive in this directory as well.

3. Open console in the musl_sqlite directory and execute:

$ ./build

The script will compile the sqlite3 library with musl and will copy
the needed files to the binary directory of AsmBB (../www/)

Report every building problems. I am testing on Manjaro/Arch linux
and some problems on other distributions are possible (but not expected)
