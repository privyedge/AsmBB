# AsmBB installation guide

## Preface

This package contains the forum engine AsmBB, which is high performance
web forum engine, written entirely in assembly language.

This package is the binary release of the engine, but it is free open source
distributed under EUPL license (the file License.txt) and you can download
the source code from the source repository (fossil), located on:

               http://asm32.info/fossil/repo/asmbb/

## Prerequisites

In order to use AsmBB you will need running web server, supporting FastCGI 
protocol. Most web servers will do the job. Particularly Apache.

You can install AsmBB on local server (for testing) on shared hosting or any
other hosting option.

The only mandatory condition is that the server must run on x86 or x86-64 
Linux platform and the fastcgi module should be enabled (most servers running
php has it enabled anyway).

AsmBB is self sufficient and does not requires any libraries or databases 
installed on the server.

In order to send mails to the forum users, AsmBB will need the address and 
port number of SMTP server that is accessible from your web server without
authentication. Most SMTP servers provided by the web hosting will not need 
authentication if connected from the local network (i.e. the web site engine).


## Installation

First unpack the files in temporary directory. Depending on your server
edit the file .htaccess (Apache) or lighttpd.conf (lighttpd) - 
Change the "_FULL_PATH_TO_DOCUMENT_ROOT_HERE_" placeholder to the real
path to your document root (it depends on the web server settings).

Upload all files (and direcrories) of the package to the document_root directory 
of your web server.

Test the forum by loading the web site in your favourite browser.

As simple as that. 


## Introduction to the forum configuration.

When run for the first time, AsmBB will create an empty database for the 
forum - a file, named board.sqlite in the root directory.

Until there is no users registered, AsmBB will run in setup mode, displaying 
the administrator user creation dialog. 

The registration of the admin user will not need email activation and is pretty
liberal about the quality of the password. But you as an administrator of the 
forum, better choose strong password and whatever nickname you prefer. 

After creation the administrator user, the access to the forum settings is 
rescticted only for the users with administrator privilegies.

Set the SMTP server and other forum parameters in the settings page.
